    <h1><b> My time in Wales so far! </b></h1>
  </l1>
  <body>
  <p> <a name = "top">Coming to Wales has certainly been an adventure. There are a lot of things that I find myself being used to now that at first amazed me. For example, I now look right, left, right when crossing a road instead of left, right, left as I would in America. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I also am less fazed now by the British accent. For example, when I'm overhearing a conversation or speaking to a clerk, it sounds almost as if they are American to me now until I actually pay attention to how they sound. 
  </p>
  <p> Food is a very important part of my travel experience no matter where I am. Here are some of my favorites so far: 
    <h2><a name = "tortilla"> Tortilla: </h2>
    <p class = tortilla>
     These burritos are very delicious and are the closest thing I have been able to find to American burritos. They use very fresh ingredients and have a very friendly staff as well.

    <h2> Five Guys: </h2>
    <p class = fiveguys>
     I never really ate Five Guys in America and I wouldn't call myself a huge burger person. But I must say, the milkshakes as well as the cajun seasoned french fries at this place are enough to keep me going at least once a week as a weekend treat. It also feels good sometimes to be in a restaurant that reminds me so much of home like Five Guys.

    <h2> Chai Street Cafe: </h2>
    <p class = chaistreet>
     This is a fantastic Indian restaurant that I found my second day in Cardiff. It is right next to Cardiff Castle within an alley of restaurants. I highly reccomend their Tikka Masala

  <h2><a name = "bottom"> Activities: </h2>
  <p> Over our time here, the study abroad group and I have been on some breath taking excursions: </p>
  <h3> Chepstow Castle: </h3> 
  <p> Chepstow Castle is definitely one of the coolest places I've been in my life. I didn't even realize that they could make castles as high up as they made this one. I would love the chance to revisit Chepstow and I highly reccomend anyone in Wales do the same.

  </p>
  <h3> Tintern Abbey </h3>
  <p>
    Tintern Abbey is a gorgeous church built in the 12th century. It amazed me how well preserved this structure was given that some parts of it were so thin looking. For example, I was surprised to see so many of its arches remaining intact despite going through nearly a thousand years of weathering.

  <h3> Witherspoons Pub: Prince of Wales </h3>
  <p> The group and I had a nice Saturday evening at one of the pubs in the city center called Witherspoons or, as the locals call it, "Spoons." It is a great atmosphere with friendly people everywhere and affordable food and drinks.
